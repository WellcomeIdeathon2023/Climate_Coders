# Methane Impacts Tracker

## Project Description

Methane Impacts Tracker is an interactive Dashboard that aims to provide policymakers with valuable insights into methane levels and their impact on population health in the USA. By visualizing methane emissions, respiratory health data, and related information, this dashboard assists policymakers in making informed decisions to address the challenges posed by methane exposure. 

This dashboard is a prototype resulting from the Wellcome Trust's 2023 Ideathon.

## Requirements

Currently, the use of this dashboard requires Python to be installed, along with relevant libraries and depencies (specified in the code). In the future, the development team plans to Dockerize this code to enable the dashboard to be run without any system requirements. 

## Installation Guide

Download the repo or clone it on your machine. 

## How to Use

- After cloning the repo, open the A_Super_Duper_Dashboard.py file in Python.
- Look at the import statements to understand which dependencies need to be loaded on your machine to enable the file to be run. Typically, dependencies can be loaded using the command "pip install".
- Run the A_Super_Duper_Dashboard.py file.
- At the bottom of the output on your terminal, you will see a link. Click this link and it will take you directly to the dashboard.
- Enjoy exploring the various tabs and interactive plots on the dashboard to gain a better understanding of methane levels and their impacts on health!
